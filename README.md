- **Course Management**: Instructors can create, update, and manage courses. They can add course materials, videos, quizzes, and assignments.

- **Enrollments and Progress Tracking**: Students can enroll in courses, track their progress, and view their completed and ongoing courses.

- **User Dashboard**: Instructors and students have personalized dashboards that display relevant information such as enrolled courses, course progress, and upcoming assignments.

- **Discussion Forums**: Students can participate in discussion forums to interact with peers and ask questions related to the course materials.

- **Notifications**: Users receive notifications regarding course updates, assignment deadlines, and other important announcements.

- **Admin Panel**: An administrative interface is available for managing courses, users, and other aspects of the e-learning platform.
